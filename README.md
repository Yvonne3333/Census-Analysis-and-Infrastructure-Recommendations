# Census-Analysis-and-Infrastructure-Recommendations
Python project analyzing census-style data to guide infrastructure planning. Cleans, visualizes, and interprets demographics to recommend improvements in schools, healthcare, transport, housing, and employment using pandas and matplotlib.

Goal: Clean and analyze census-style data to produce data-driven infrastructure recommendations such as where to build schools, clinics, or old-age care facilities.

Core Features:
Automated data cleaning (fixes age/marital inconsistencies, normalizes religion/infirmity fields, maps employment categories).
EDA on demographics, religion, health, and household composition.
Generates recommendations for housing, education, transport, healthcare, and employment based on population insights.
Compares before vs. after data cleaning effects through visualizations.
Tech Stack: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook)

How to Use:
Install dependencies.
Place your census CSV data in a /data folder.
Run the notebook in Jupyter.
Review the visual outputs and recommendations.

Outputs:
Cleaned dataset (CSV)
Plots (PNG)
Recommendation tables
